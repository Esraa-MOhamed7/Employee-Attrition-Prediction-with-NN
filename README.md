# üîç Employee Attrition Prediction with Neural Networks  
## Project Overview

This project uses a neural network to predict whether an employee is likely to **stay** or **leave** based on workplace and personal features.

---

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Importing Libraries  
Essential packages for data handling, visualization, and modeling.

### 2. Data Exploration  
Quick inspection using `.head()`, `.info()`, `.isnull()`, and `.describe()` to understand the dataset‚Äôs structure and quality.

### 3. Data Analysis  
Visual storytelling to uncover patterns, class imbalance, and feature relationships.

### 4. Data Transformation  
Encoding categorical features and scaling numeric ones using `StandardScaler`.

### 5. Modeling  
Building and training a neural network to classify employee attrition.

### 6. Model Evaluation & Visualization  
Assessing performance using confusion matrix, ROC curve, precision-recall curve, and training history plots.
